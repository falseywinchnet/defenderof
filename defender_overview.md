# Defender Of: The Video Game

## Document 1: Master Overview

This document serves as the **overview** and "table of contents" for the game design package. It describes the concept, gameplay loop, and how the other documents are organized. The goal is to provide a clear roadmap for development.

### ðŸŽ® Game Concept
**Defender Of** is a satirical, progressive defense RPG with clicker-style mechanics. The player moves between different **scenes/zones** and must defeat escalating waves of enemies using items, actions, and strategic upgrades. Currency (pennies, coins) is earned to unlock stronger tools, items, and abilities.

The game evolves across multiple **arcs**:
- **Arc 1: Home & Wilderness Defense** (flies â†’ wasps â†’ coyotes â†’ sorcerers)
- **Arc 2: Society & Corruption** (paperwork â†’ teenagers â†’ mafia â†’ mastermind)
- **Arc 3: Cosmic/Meta Conflict** (nation â†’ world â†’ universe â†’ the video game itself)

### ðŸŒ€ Core Gameplay Loop

2. **Defend** â†’ Click/timed actions to fight enemies. Manage cooldowns.
3. **Earn Currency** â†’ Defeating enemies gives pennies or higher-tier currency.
4. **Upgrade** â†’ Buy items, unlock stronger attacks, or new mechanics.
5. **Boss Fight / Pester Event** â†’ Progression is gated by bosses or special pester mechanics.
6. **Advance to Next Zone** â†’ Unlocks the next environment and tier of enemies.
